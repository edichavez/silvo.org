	    <h1>Devon Farms</h1>
	      <p>Most farms in the South West have been using single farming methods for many years. This method allows easy collection of the crops, but impoverishes the land with each rotation. The truth is that the historic land in which we cultivate is a non-renewable resource which, once lost, it cannot be recreated.</p>
          <p>This use of the land requires added chemicals, which in turn damages the soil quality. As well as the loss of nutrients, the potential of this land being used for environmental causes is lost. This is, through the elimination of CO2 by the planting of trees.</p>
	    <h1>Benefits of Mixed Farming</h1>
		
		<img src="img/farm.jpg">
		
		 <p>Mixed farming or Silvopasture the practice of combining woodland and the grazing of domesticated animals in a mutually beneficial way. This technology also allows greater food security and improved household nutrition levels. In addition, farmers can generate a surplus of some products that can be sold at market.</p>
		 <p> This method benefits the soil fertility and biodiversity as well as improving efficiency of the land.</p>
         <br>
		 <ul>
		   <li>Mixed farming systems maintain soil fertility by recycling soil nutrients and allowing the introduction and use of rotations between various crops and forage legumes and trees, or for land to remain fallow and grasses and shrubs to become re-established.</li>
 
           <li>Mixed farming systems maintain soil biodiversity, minimise soil erosion, help to conserve water and provide suitable habitats for birds.</li>
 
           <li>Mixed farming systems make the best use of crop residues. When they are not used as feed, stalks may be incorporated directly into the soil, where, for some time, they act as a nitrogen trap, exacerbating deficiencies. Burning the crop residues, the other alternative, increases carbon dioxide emissions.</li>
 
           <li>Mixed farming systems allow intensified farming, with less dependence on natural resources and preserving more biodiversity than would be the case if food demands were to be met by crop and livestock activities undertaken in isolation.</li>
		 </ul>
		   
           <p>The ability to include a pasture phase or green manure into the system is paramount in building the soil and the profitability of the farm. Adding livestock to this simply means there is a return on the money invested in these tools immediately.</p>
